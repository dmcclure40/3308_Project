##Description:

The Leap Motion controlled Robotic Arm will use the movements of a user's hand to move a robotic arm. The Leap motion detects hand movements in all directions that will be mapped to the three axis that a robotic arm will move. A Raspberry Pi will be used as the medium between the input device as the Leap Motion and the output device as the Arm. This could potentially be used for precise movements for people that do not have the strength, or ability to perform a task using their own arm. 

##Vision Statement:

Controlling an artificial limb in a natural way.

##Motivation:

This project would solve a problem that does not yet have an easy solution. Users will be able to control a non-natural robotic limb in a very natural way. This project could also be further developed and improved upon later in our college careers to do more and work better.

##Risks:
* Being new to working with Raspberry Pi.
* Timeline to finish working project may be too short.
* Expenses for a robotic arm may be difficult to invest in.

##Risk Mitigation Strategy:
* Read up on and become familiar with Raspberry Pi.
* Make sure we are communicating well and exchanging schedules.
* Use inexpensive arm parts such as legos.
##Requirements:

###User Requirements###

Requirement Number| Description|Size
---------|--------|------------
1.0 | Intuitive and easy control |
2.0 | Doesn’t need knowledge of inner workings |
3.0 | Simple way to start and stop |

###Functional Requirements###

Requirement Number| Description | Size
---------|--------|-----------
1.0 | Uses a motion tracking device for input |
2.0 | Leap input should communicate with arm |
3.0 | The arm must have 3 joints |
4.0 | The end must have a grabber of sorts |
5.0 | Should be able to pick things up |
6.0 | Should be able to rotate 360˚ |
7.0 | Should be able to move each limb/joint individually |
8.0 | Basic hand movements should translate to arm movements |

###Non-Functional Requirements###

Requirement Number| Description | Size
---------|--------|---------------
1.0 | Fluid motions / non-abrupt |
2.0 | Latency between input and arm must be short |

##Methodology

Waterfall at first for foundation, then switch to agile.
